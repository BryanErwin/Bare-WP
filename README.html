<h1>Bare Development Theme</h1>

<p>A starting point for WordPress development projects.</p>

<h2>CodeKit</h2>

<p>I use CodeKit to handle all of my tasks as I work. It compiles my Sass, concatonates and minifies my javascript, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I have included my codekit.config in this repo so it can be as easy as dragging the project folder into CodeKit and then you are up and running. If you don&rsquo;t have CodeKit you can purchase it here https://incident57.com/codekit/</p>

<h2>Sass</h2>

<p>This starter bundle uses Sass as a CSS preprocessor. I like my Sass handled a specific way and that is setup in the codekit.config file, but obviously you can set it up however you want.</p>

<h2>Retina Images</h2>

<p>retina.js is prepended to scripts.js and will handle all of your inline retina image needs. You can learn more about it and how it works at http://retinajs.com/. There is also a mixin called retina-sprite that you can use to handle all of your retina images in CSS. Take a look at the mixin as you may have to change the path to the file as well as the background size to get it working.</p>
